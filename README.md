### Current section:
#### OSNIR Prediction based on the following ML Techniques:

- [x] [Linear Regression](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Linear%20Regression/OSNIR_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
- [x] [Multivariate Polynomial Regression](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Multivariate%20Polynomial%20Regression/OSNIR_Polynomial_Regression.ipynb)
- [x] [Decision Tree](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Decision%20Tree/OSNIR_Decision_Tree.ipynb)
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] Support Vector Regression
- [ ] k-Nearest Neighbors
- [x] [Deep Neural Network](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Neural%20Network/OSNIR_NeuralNetwork.ipynb)

Up Next: Random Forest :robot:

To Do after all ML are complete:
- [ ] Code and markdown cleanup
- [ ] Final plots adjustments
- [ ] Compare plots to paper
