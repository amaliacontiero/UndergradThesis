### Current section:
#### OSNIR Prediction based on the following ML Techniques:

- [x] [Linear Regression](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Linear%20Regression/OSNIR_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
- [ ] Multivariate Polynomial Regression
- [ ] Decision Tree
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] Support Vector Regression
- [ ] k-Nearest Neighbors
- [x] [Deep Neural Network](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Neural%20Network/OSNIR_NeuralNetwork.ipynb)

Up Next: Multivariate Polynomial Regression :robot:

To Do after all ML are complete:
- [ ] Code and markdown cleanup
- [ ] Final plots adjustments
