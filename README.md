### Current section:
#### OSNIR Prediction based on the following ML Techniques:

- [x] [Linear Regression](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Linear%20Regression/OSNIR_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
- [x] [Multivariate Polynomial Regression](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Multivariate%20Polynomial%20Regression/OSNIR_Polynomial_Regression.ipynb)
- [x] [Decision Tree](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Decision%20Tree/OSNIR_Decision_Tree.ipynb)
- [x] [Random Forest](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Random%20Forest/OSNIR_Random_Forest.ipynb)
- [x] [Support Vector Regression](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Support%20Vector%20Regression/OSNIR_SVR.ipynb)
- [x] [k-Nearest Neighbors](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/k-Nearest%20Neighbors/OSNIR_kNN.ipynb)
- [x] [Deep Neural Network](/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques/Neural%20Network/OSNIR_Neural_Network.ipynb)

Up Next: What's Next? :robot:

To Do after all ML are complete:
- [x] Code and markdown cleanup
- [x] Final plots adjustments
- [x] All plots same height (except kNN)
- [x] Compare plots to paper
